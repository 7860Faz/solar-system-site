# Solar System API app

React and TailWind CSS web app learning project.

This app lets users search Solar System Planets and Moons, displaying
physical characterstics as well as a photo from the NASA image
library.

This is the first project where I work with libraries and frameworks
in JavaScript.

The APIs I used are:
- [le systeme solaire API](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/)
for planetary/lunar data
- [NASA image API](https://api.nasa.gov/) for pictures
